# Lip Reading Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Lip Reading project! Our goal is to create an end-to-end machine learning solution for word detection in videos using cutting-edge deep learning techniques, specifically LSTM and neural networks. This innovative system is designed to improve traditional speech recognition, particularly in noisy environments, while eliminating the requirement for transcribed audio data. By doing so, it opens doors to multi-modal applications and greatly enhances accessibility for individuals with hearing impairments, serving as a vital communication tool.

## Key Features

- **Deep Learning Architecture:** Leveraging the power of LSTM and neural networks for robust word detection in videos.
  
- **Enhanced Speech Recognition:** Addressing challenges in traditional speech recognition, especially in noisy settings.

- **No Transcribed Audio Data Required:** Eliminating the need for manually transcribed audio data, streamlining the learning process.

- **Multi-Modal Applications:** Enabling the integration of lip reading into multi-modal applications for versatile use.

- **Accessibility Improvement:** Significantly improving accessibility for individuals with hearing impairments, promoting inclusive communication.
