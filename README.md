LIP READING USING DEEP LEARNING\n
The project aims to develop an end-to-end machine learning solution for word detection in videos using deep learning, specifically LSTM and neural networks. This system will enhance traditional speech recognition, especially in noisy settings, while eliminating the need for transcribed audio data. It enables multi-modal applications and significantly improves accessibility for individuals with hearing impairments by serving as a crucial communication tool.
